# HELLO WORLD

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hour Sprint_

This project is my introduction to HTML and CSS. I was tasked with creating an HTML file that would display my name, an image, some information about myself, and a quote. I styled the page using pure CSS, this was my first time sourcing a CSS file into an HTML file and it required me to research on how link and script tags worked.
